          I'd love to be as inclusive as possible. This project has just started. Please feel free to share your knowledge on organizations, NGOs, Apps, Software, etc. you‚Äôd think would fit in here. <br />
          Right now the offers I share here are unfortunately available in German. The outpatient clinic for victims DEFINITELY takes care of you if you can't speak German, but the websites are in German.

        <h2><span>Find the nearest Outpatient Clinic for Victims</span></h2>
        <p>
        Victim and trauma outpatient clinics ("Opfer- und Trauerambulanz / OTA") are contact points in Germany, Austria and Switzerland for the acute care of victims of traumatizing events, especially victims of violent and sexual crimes.
        </p>
        <p>
        According to recent EU statistics, <strong>one in four women in Germany</strong> will experience physical or sexual violence at some point in their lives, often within a domestic setting. In such cases, victims often find it difficult to immediately decide to file a report. This decision is frequently made some time after the event, by which point it may be too late to collect evidence.
        </p>
        <p>
        Examinations should take place <em>as soon as possible after the incident</em>, potentially even at night. Crucial evidence can be collected in the first few hours following a crime, which might otherwise be lost forever. Therefore, contact with the violence clinic should occur without delay.
        </p>
        <p>
        Victims receive <strong>confidential, free-of-charge, and legally admissible examinations</strong>. If they decide to press charges later, the anonymously collected evidence can be retrieved. The evidence is stored to be used when needed - sometimes up to 6 years. But the time limits differ from clinic to clinic. So please asked the medical staff at the clinic. Additionally, upon request, contact can be made with victim support organizations or anonymous telephone counseling services.
